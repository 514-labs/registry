# Limits and Considerations

This document outlines important limitations and considerations when using the SAP HANA CDC connector.

## Database Limits

### SAP HANA Version Requirements

- **Minimum Version**: SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 05 or later
- **Recommended Version**: SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 06 or later for optimal performance

### Database Permissions

The connector requires the following database permissions:

- **CREATE TABLE**: To create the change tracking table
- **CREATE TRIGGER**: To create triggers on monitored tables
- **DROP TRIGGER**: To remove triggers when needed
- **SELECT**: On monitored tables and system tables
- **INSERT**: On the change tracking table

### Recommended User Setup

```sql
-- Create dedicated CDC user
CREATE USER cdc_user PASSWORD "secure_password";

-- Grant required permissions
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO cdc_user;
GRANT CREATE TRIGGER TO cdc_user;
GRANT DROP TRIGGER TO cdc_user;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA "YOUR_SCHEMA" TO cdc_user;
GRANT INSERT ON SCHEMA "YOUR_SCHEMA" TO cdc_user;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Trigger Overhead

- **Impact**: Each monitored table will have triggers that execute on every change
- **Mitigation**: Monitor only necessary tables, exclude high-frequency system tables
- **Measurement**: Test in development environment to measure impact

### Change Table Growth

- **Storage**: Change table grows continuously with all database changes
- **Retention**: Implement data retention policies to manage table size
- **Indexing**: Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns

### Memory Usage

- **Batch Size**: Large batch sizes consume more memory
- **JSON Parsing**: Large JSON documents require more memory
- **Recommendation**: Use appropriate batch sizes (100-1000 records)

## Operational Limits

### Table Monitoring

- **Maximum Tables**: No hard limit, but performance degrades with many tables
- **Recommended**: Monitor 50-100 tables maximum for optimal performance
- **Large Tables**: Tables with millions of rows may impact trigger performance

### Change Volume

- **High Frequency**: Tables with >1000 changes/second may impact performance
- **Bulk Operations**: Large batch operations may generate many change events
- **Monitoring**: Monitor change table growth and query performance

### Network and Connectivity

- **Connection Timeout**: Default SAP HANA connection timeout applies
- **Network Latency**: High latency may impact real-time performance
- **Reconnection**: Connector handles connection drops automatically

## Data Consistency

### Transaction Boundaries

- **Atomicity**: Changes within a transaction are captured together
- **Ordering**: Changes are ordered by timestamp within transactions
- **Isolation**: Changes reflect committed transactions only

### Timing Considerations

- **Real-time**: Changes are captured as they occur (near real-time)
- **Trigger Delay**: Minimal delay due to trigger execution
- **Batch Processing**: Processing delays depend on polling frequency

## Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity

- **Full Data Capture**: All column values are captured in change events
- **Sensitive Data**: Consider excluding sensitive columns or implementing encryption
- **Access Control**: Secure access to change tracking table

### Network Security

- **Encryption**: Use encrypted connections to SAP HANA
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
- **Network Isolation**: Consider network-level security controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure user has all required permissions
2. **Trigger Creation Failures**: Check table structure and permissions
3. **Connection Timeouts**: Verify network connectivity and credentials
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size or implement pagination

### Monitoring

- **Change Table Size**: Monitor growth and implement retention
- **Trigger Performance**: Monitor database performance metrics
- **Error Rates**: Track and alert on connection or processing errors

### Recovery

- **Connection Drops**: Connector automatically reconnects
- **Partial Failures**: Some changes may be lost during failures
- **Data Integrity**: Verify change table consistency after issues

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a few tables and expand gradually
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track database and application performance
3. **Implement Retention**: Set up data retention policies
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test in development environment first
5. **Backup Strategy**: Include change table in backup strategy
6. **Documentation**: Document table selection and configuration decisions
