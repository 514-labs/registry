# DimensionHeader (Type)

Describes a dimension column in the report response.

## Properties

- `name`: The dimension's name

## Usage

This is a **TYPE** that appears in report responses to describe the dimension columns. Each DimensionHeader corresponds to a dimension requested in the report and helps identify the dimension values in each row of the response.

The number of DimensionHeaders in a response equals the number of dimensions requested in the report.

This file accompanies `DimensionHeader.schema.json` for a programmatic definition.
