## Getting Started â€” Connect to Shopify (Readâ€‘Only)

This guide explains how to prepare your Shopify store and configuration so the Python Shopify connector can read data from your store using the GraphQL Admin API under the hood.

### Prerequisites

- A Shopify store (development store recommended for testing)
- Admin access to create a custom app in the store
- Decision on auth mode (custom app token vs public app OAuth)

**Note**: If you don't have a Shopify store yet, you can create a development store through [Shopify Partners](https://partners.shopify.com) for free testing.

### Development Store Setup (Recommended for Testing)

If you're new to Shopify development, we recommend starting with a development store:

1. **Create a Shopify Partners Account**: Go to [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com) and sign up for a free account
2. **Create a Development Store**: In your Partners dashboard, click "Stores" â†’ "Add store" â†’ "Development store"
3. **Store Details**: Choose a name and select "Development store" as the store type
4. **Populate with Test Data**: Choose "populate with generated test data" during creation to start with realistic products, customers, and orders
5. **Access**: You'll get admin access to this store for testing your connector
6. **Benefits**: Development stores are free, can't process real payments, and are perfect for API testing

**Note**: Your store URL will be `your-name.myshopify.com` - keep this for API calls.

### Test Data and Checkout Flows

For realistic testing of your connector, especially if you'll be reading orders and payment data:

1. **Generated Test Data**: Choose "populate with generated test data" when creating your development store to start with realistic products, customers, and orders
2. **Test Payment Gateway**: Enable Bogus Gateway (or Shopify Payments test mode) to place test orders without real charges
3. **Test Order Flow**: Use Shopify's test card numbers to simulate successful and failed payments
4. **Sample Data Apps**: If you want different test fixtures, you can add sample data apps from the Shopify App Store

**Why This Matters**: Having realistic test data ensures your connector can handle real-world scenarios and edge cases during development.

### Shopify CLI (Optional for Future Development)

If you later decide to turn your connector into an installable Shopify app:

1. **Install Shopify CLI**: `npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme`
2. **Login**: `shopify auth login`
3. **App Development**: Use `shopify app dev` for local development with hot reloading
4. **Store Preview**: `shopify store preview` to test your app in different store contexts

**Note**: This is optional for the current read-only connector implementation but useful if you plan to expand functionality later.

### Choose authentication mode

- Recommended for singleâ€‘store setups: custom app with Admin API access token.
- Public app OAuth (Shopify Partners) is possible but not required for readâ€‘only extraction in one store. Note: order data for public apps may require additional approvals from Shopify.

**Important Note**: This connector uses the **GraphQL Admin API** by default with no REST fallback in this release. Provide `SHOPIFY_SHOP`, `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` (e.g., `2025-07`), and `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` before use. REST may be added later if needed.

**Future Considerations**: 
- REST API will continue to work for existing implementations
- New public apps distributed after April 1, 2025, must use GraphQL
- For read-only data extraction, REST provides a simpler, more straightforward interface
- If you need to build a distributable app later, consider migrating to GraphQL

### Create a custom app and token

1. **Access the Shopify Admin**: Log into your Shopify store admin panel
2. **Navigate to Apps**: Go to Settings â†’ Apps and sales channels â†’ Develop apps (enable if prompted)
3. **Create an App**: Click "Create an app" and give it a name
4. **Configure Admin API access**:
   - In the app configuration, go to "Admin API access scopes"
   - Grant only the read scopes you need (leastâ€‘privilege principle):
     - **Products/Variants/Collections**: `read_products`, `read_collections` (or `read_collection_listings`)
     - **Inventory/Locations**: `read_inventory`, `read_locations`
     - **Orders/Fulfillments/Transactions**: `read_orders`, `read_fulfillments`
     - **Customers**: `read_customers`
5. **Install the app**: Click "Install app" to add it to your store
6. **Get the access token**: After installation, you'll see the "Admin API access token" - this is your authentication credential
7. **Store securely**: Save this token; it will be sent as the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header with every API request

**Understanding API Scopes**: Each scope grants access to specific data. For example:
- `read_products` allows you to fetch products, variants, and their metadata
- `read_orders` gives access to order history, customer details, and fulfillment status
- `read_inventory` provides current stock levels across locations
- Start with minimal scopes and add more as needed for your use case

### Collect configuration values

- Shop domain: `your-store.myshopify.com` (no protocol)
- API version: e.g., `2025-07` (pin a stable version)
- Access token: from the custom app install page
- Optional: proxy/TLS settings, request timeout, concurrency preferences

### Environment variables (example)

```bash
export SHOPIFY_SHOP="your-store.myshopify.com"
export SHOPIFY_API_VERSION="2025-07"
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your-admin-api-access-token>"
```

### Connector configuration mapping

Use these values when configuring the connector:

```json
{
  "shop": "{SHOPIFY_SHOP}",
  "apiVersion": "2025-07",
  "accessToken": "<SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
  "useGraphQL": true,
  "defaults": { "query": { "limit": 250 } }
}
```

**Note**: This is a minimal configuration. For advanced options including retry policies, rate limiting, connection pooling, and hooks, see the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

### Validate credentials (smoke test)

- Make a read request to `GET /admin/api/{version}/shop.json` with header `X-Shopify-Access-Token: <token>`
- A 200 response confirms domain, version, and token are correct
- Expect `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit: used/40` in response headers

**Optional REST Smoke Test (Manual)**:

```python
import requests

store = "your-store-name"               # no https, just the subdomain
token = "shpat_xxx"                     # Admin API access token
url = f"https://{store}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-07/shop.json"

r = requests.get(url, headers={
    "X-Shopify-Access-Token": token
})
r.raise_for_status()
print(r.json())

# If that returns shop data, your connector is authenticated and ready to go
```

### Operational considerations

- **Rate limits**: REST uses a 40-token leaky bucket at â‰ˆ2 rps; GraphQL uses a cost-based model. The connector adapts from `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` and maps GraphQL cost extensions into headers for visibility. 429 is retried with backoff and `Retry-After`.
- **Pagination**: Uses GraphQL cursors (`edges`/`pageInfo`) with `limit` defaulted and capped internally (â‰¤250).
- **Versioning**: Pin `apiVersion` and monitor `X-Shopify-Api-Deprecated-Reason` warnings.
- **Security**: Never commit tokens; store secrets securely.

### Public app OAuth (optional)

- Create an app in Shopify Partners, configure redirect URLs, and request the same read scopes as above.
- Be aware of restrictions for protected data (e.g., orders) and Shopifyâ€™s approval process.

### Next steps

- Provide the shop domain, API version, and access token to the connector's configuration.
- Start with low scope reads (Products/Customers) and validate pagination and rate limits before scaling to Orders.

### Optional: generate test customers and orders

For richer test data, you can programmatically create customers and orders in a development store. The helper script uses GraphQL to create customers and draft orders, completes them, then creates a REST test transaction (Bogus gateway) so `order.test == true`.

Prerequisites:
- Development store with Bogus Gateway (or Shopify Payments in test mode) enabled
- Admin token with write scopes: `write_customers`, `write_draft_orders`, `write_orders`

Usage:
```bash
# Reuse existing customers tagged automation-test
python test/test_create_test_orders.py --count 1000 --skip-customers --customer-tag automation-test

# Create new customers and orders (avoid duplicates with an offset)
python test/test_create_test_orders.py --count 1000 --customer-tag automation-test --customer-offset 1000

# Handle draft order REST rate limits more patiently
python test/test_create_test_orders.py --count 50 --skip-customers --customer-tag automation-test --rest-retries 8 --rest-sleep 70

# Add --verbose for additional logging
python test/test_create_test_orders.py --count 10 --skip-customers --customer-tag automation-test --verbose
```

Notes:
- Shopify credentials are read from your shell environment: `SHOPIFY_SHOP`, `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- The script tags customers and orders with `automation-test` by default.
- The script respects Shopify rate limits and will back off on draft order completion when necessary.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized**: Check that your access token is correct and hasn't been revoked
**403 Forbidden**: Verify you have the correct API scopes enabled for the endpoint you're trying to access
**404 Not Found**: Ensure your shop domain is correct and the API version exists
**429 Too Many Requests**: The connector handles this automatically, but you can monitor rate limit headers
**500+ Server Errors**: These are usually temporary; the connector will retry automatically
