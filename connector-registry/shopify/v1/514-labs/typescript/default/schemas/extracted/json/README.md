# Extracted JSON Schemas

This directory contains normalized/transformed JSON schemas.

## Organization

Like raw schemas, extracted schemas can be organized in nested folders:
- `entities/` - Normalized business entities
- `metrics/` - Calculated metrics or aggregations
- `reports/` - Structured report schemas
- Or any logical grouping for your transformed data

## Naming Convention

Use the same folder structure as in `raw/endpoints/` when there's a 1:1 mapping, or create new logical groupings for transformed data.
