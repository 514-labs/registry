## Blob Storage Connectors

Connectors for cloud storage services like S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.

### Goals

- Provide consistent configuration across providers (credentials, region, bucket/container)
- Normalize listing, reading, writing, and deleting objects
- Support pagination and streaming for large files

### Core Operations

1. List objects with prefix and pagination support
2. Get object metadata (size, content-type, etag, last-modified)
3. Read object (buffer or stream)
4. Write object (buffer or stream) with content-type and ACL options
5. Delete single object or batch delete

### Error Handling

- Missing object → NotFound error
- Permission issues → Authorization error
- Transient network failures → Retries with backoff

### Observability

- Emit metrics for request counts, latency, size transferred
- Structured logs with request IDs and provider operation names
