# Create your own connector

In order to create your own connector you'll need to do the following:

1. Install the connector factory CLI (includes an MCP to speed up development)
2. Initialize a project with your connector scaffold in the language of your choice

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://connectors.514.ai/install.sh) [connector-name] [version] [author] [language]
```

3. Follow [the spec](/docs/specifications) and ask your favorite AI to generate the connector for you
4. <Link href="/share">Share</Link> your connector to the connectors hub (optional)
