# Introduction

We created this project because we believe that connectors should be
open source, free and easy to integrate, debug and maintain.

## Our thesis

Connectors are the building blocks to all data-intensive applications.
Everyone hates creating them and the only thing worst than creating
them is maintaining them.

Connector providers have taken advantage of this by creating opaque,
expensive connectors that you pay for but never actually own.

It's time to change that.

### What this project is

- rock solid set of absractions and connector implementation patterns
- prompts and tools to build & test connectors that you own
- tools to distribute those connectors, integrate them directly in
  your applications and share them with your friends

### What this project is not

- A way to swindle you into paying for commodity software
- A set of connectors that you can opaquely integrate into your
  applications
- A way to build connectors that you can't understand
- A way for any one company to own the connector market

## Who we think will use this

- Developers building data-intensive applications that need resilience, observability and control
- Data warehousing providers who need to create connectors to pull data into their warehouse
- Data platform providers who need to create connectors to pull data into their platform
