## SaaS Connectors

Connectors for Software-as-a-Service platforms and third-party services.

### Goals

- Normalized auth (API key, OAuth2, custom token schemes)
- Consistent pagination, rate limiting, and retry behavior
- Standardized error taxonomy (auth, validation, rate-limit, server)

### Core Capabilities

1. Authentication helpers and token refresh (where applicable)
2. Resource listing with cursor/page-based pagination
3. Webhook subscription/verification (if supported)
4. Idempotent write operations with conflict handling

### Rate Limiting & Retries

- Respect provider headers (X-RateLimit-*)
- Exponential backoff with jitter for 429/5xx

### Observability

- Request/response logging with PII scrubbing
- Metrics: request counts, latency, rate-limit hits
