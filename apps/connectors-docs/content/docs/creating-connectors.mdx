# Creating connectors

Follow these steps to create your own connector:

## 1. Clone the repository

Clone the connector factory repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/514-labs/factory.git
cd factory
```

## 2. Generate a connector scaffold

From the connector factory directory, run the install script to generate a new connector with the appropriate structure:

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://connectors.514.ai/install.sh) [connector-name] [version] [author] [language]
```

**Example:**
```bash
bash -i <(curl https://connectors.514.ai/install.sh) ads-b-dot-lol v2 fiveonefour typescript
```

This creates a new directory with your connector scaffold in the chosen language.

## 3. Determine your connector type

Identify which type of connector you're building:

- **API Connector**: For general REST/GraphQL APIs
- **SaaS Connector**: For third-party SaaS platforms and services
- **Database Connector**: For SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Blob Storage Connector**: For cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)

## 4. Follow the specifications

Feed your LLM the relevant specifications and documentation:

1. **Target API documentation**: Share the official API docs of the service you're connecting to (e.g., [Stripe API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api), [Shopify API docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/api))
2. **Type-specific specs**: Include the appropriate specification:
   - [API Connector Spec](/docs/specifications) for general REST/GraphQL APIs
   - [SaaS Connector Spec](/docs/specifications) for third-party SaaS platforms
   - [Database Connector Spec](/docs/specifications) for SQL databases  
   - [Blob Storage Connector Spec](/docs/specifications) for cloud storage
3. **Example connectors**: Reference existing connectors in the registry for patterns
   - API Connectors: ADS-B.lol, OpenWeather
   - SaaS Connectors: [Google Analytics](/connector-registry/google-analytics/v4/fiveonefour/typescript/README.md), [Shopify](/connector-registry/shopify/v2025-01/fiveonefour/typescript/README.md)
   - [coming soon] Database Connectors: PostgreSQL
   - [coming soon] Blob Storage Connectors: S3

Your LLM can then help generate the connector implementation following the established patterns and specifications.
