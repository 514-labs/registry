# Connector scaffold

Below is a visualization of the connector registry scaffolds. Each section shows the folder layout generated by the scaffold and the intent of the key folders.

<ConnectorScaffoldTrees />

## What the folders mean

### `{connector}/_meta`
- Holds connector-level metadata that is provider-agnostic.
- **Files**: `connector.json`, `README.md`, and `assets/` for shared logos/images.
- Do not place documentation here; documentation belongs with the language implementation directories.

### `{connector}/{version}/_meta`
- Version-level metadata for the connector.
- **Files**: `version.json`, `README.md`, and `assets/`.

### `{connector}/{version}/{author}/_meta`
- Provider/author-specific metadata and assets.
- **Files**: `connector.json` (capabilities, languages), `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `assets/`.

### Language implementations under `{connector}/{version}/{author}`
- `typescript/{implementation}/` (and optionally `python/` if provided) contain the runnable implementation.
- Follow these conventions:
  - `docs/` for human-facing guides (getting started, configuration, limits, schema docs)
  - `schemas/` at the top level of the language directory for machine-readable definitions and related Markdown
  - `src/` for code with subfolders like `auth/`, `extract/`, `transform/`, `load/`
  - `tests/` for unit tests
  - `examples/` for usage samples

## Notes
- `_meta` folders should not include docs; keep docs with the language-specific implementation.
- Schemas should live at the top level of each language implementation (not under `src`).
