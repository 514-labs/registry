# Pipeline scaffold

Below is a visualization of the pipeline registry scaffolds. Each section shows the folder layout generated by the scaffold and the intent of the key folders.

<PipelineScaffoldTrees />

## What the folders mean

### `{pipeline}/_meta`
- Holds pipeline-level metadata that is provider-agnostic.
- **Files**: `pipeline.json`, `README.md`, and `assets/` for images and lineage diagrams.
- Avoid placing detailed implementation docs here; keep docs near the language implementation.

### `{pipeline}/{version}/_meta`
- Version-level metadata for the pipeline.
- **Files**: `version.json`, `README.md`, and `assets/`.

### `{pipeline}/{version}/{author}/_meta`
- Provider/author-specific metadata and lineage assets.
- **Files**: `pipeline.json` (executable spec), `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `assets/` (e.g., `lineage.mmd`, `lineage.svg`).

### Language implementations under `{pipeline}/{version}/{author}`
- `python/{implementation}/` and `typescript/{implementation}/` contain helpers and runnable code.
- Prefer placing docs adjacent to the implementation:
  - `docs/` for human-facing guides (getting started, config, outputs)
  - `schemas/` at the top level of the language directory for machine-readable datasets/index
  - `src/` for code (with subfolders like `extract/`, `transform/`, `load/`)
  - `tests/` for unit tests
  - `scripts/` for automation like lineage generation

## Notes
- `_meta` folders are for metadata and assets. Keep implementation docs inside the language directories.
- Place schemas at the top level of each language implementation (not under `src`).
