## Database Connectors

Connectors for various database systems including SQL and NoSQL databases.

### Goals

- Uniform connection configuration (host, port, database, credentials, SSL)
- Pooled connections with sane defaults
- Unified query/command execution with typed results where applicable

### Core Capabilities

1. Health check and version info
2. Query execution (parameterized) with streaming for large result sets
3. Transaction support with commit/rollback
4. Schema inspection (tables, columns, indexes) where supported

### Error Handling

- Syntax/constraint errors surfaced with provider codes
- Connection errors retried with backoff, transparent pool recovery

### Observability

- Metrics for query counts, latency, rows, errors
- Trace spans for query execution and transactions
