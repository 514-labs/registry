# Registry API

The Connector Factory provides open APIs for accessing registry information. These APIs allow developers to programmatically access connector and pipeline metadata, scaffolds, and registry contents.

## Base URL

```
https://registry.docs.moose.dev/api
```

## OpenAPI Specification

The full OpenAPI specification is available at:
- [/api/openapi](/api/openapi) - YAML format
- [View in Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://registry.docs.moose.dev/api/openapi)

## Available Endpoints

### Registry Contents

Get the current contents of the registry with filtering capabilities.

<Codeblock>
```bash
GET /api/registry/contents
```
</Codeblock>

Query parameters:
- `type` - Filter by type: `connector` or `pipeline`
- `language` - Filter by language: `typescript` or `python`
- `author` - Filter by author/organization
- `tags` - Filter by tags (comma-separated)

Example:
<Codeblock>
```bash
curl "https://registry.docs.moose.dev/api/registry/contents?type=connector&language=typescript"
```
</Codeblock>

### Connector Scaffold Template

Get the scaffold template for creating new connectors in a specific language.

<Codeblock>
```bash
GET /api/connectors/scaffolds/{language}
```
</Codeblock>

Supported languages: `typescript`, `python`

Example:
<Codeblock>
```bash
curl "https://registry.docs.moose.dev/api/connectors/scaffolds/typescript"
```
</Codeblock>

### Pipeline Scaffold Template

Get the scaffold template for creating new pipelines in a specific language.

<Codeblock>
```bash
GET /api/pipelines/scaffolds/{language}
```
</Codeblock>

Supported languages: `typescript`, `python`

Example:
<Codeblock>
```bash
curl "https://registry.docs.moose.dev/api/pipelines/scaffolds/typescript"
```
</Codeblock>

## Response Formats

All API responses are in JSON format. The scaffold endpoints return template structures with variables and file/directory definitions:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.connector-factory.dev/scaffold.schema.json",
  "scaffold": "typescript",
  "version": "0.6.0",
  "description": "TypeScript implementation scaffold",
  "variables": {
    "connector": {
      "description": "Connector name (kebab-case)",
      "example": "stripe",
      "pattern": "^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$"
    }
  },
  "structure": [
    {
      "type": "dir",
      "name": "{connector}",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "file",
          "name": "README.md",
          "template": "# {connector}\n\nConnector implementation..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

These APIs are served as static endpoints and are heavily cached. There are no strict rate limits, but please be respectful of the service.
