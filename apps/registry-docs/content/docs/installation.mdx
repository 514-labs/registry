# Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to add a connector to your project.

## 1. Discover available connectors

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://registry.514.ai/install.sh) --list
```

## 2. Install a connector

Run the installer with: `<connector> <version> <author> <language> <implementation>`.

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://registry.514.ai/install.sh) <connector> <version> <author> <language> <implementation>
```

Examples:

```bash
bash -i <(curl https://registry.514.ai/install.sh) google-analytics v4 fiveonefour typescript data-api
```

The installer will scaffold the connector into your current directory under the name of the connector.

## 3. Next steps

- Follow the connector's docs in the generated folder to run examples and integrate into your app.
- Re-run the installer at any time to add more connectors, or use `--list` to discover options.
